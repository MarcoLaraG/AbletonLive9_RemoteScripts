Features

Shift + Rec = Overdub

Mixer  button 9 - arm selected track

Shift changes mixer buttons to be arm the specific track button. 

Known issues (todo:)
1) impulse does not disconnect properly and does  not send disconnection message. 
1.5) refactor shift - move it to main class.
2) After moving track with Shift+Track buttons are not returned to inital condition. 
    Also happens sometimes in other cases (like bank switching with Shift). 
   Workaround - press and release Shit again.
3) when track goes down, the bank is not changed. 
4) Pressin shift + (mutes/solos) flip button leds to unpredictable results.
   Workaround - do not do that, if you have done that, just press and release shift.



Future things to implement. 

1) mixer9 - overdub
2) Shift + Mixer 9 - automation arm
3) Shift + Stop - stop all clips.
   
   
4) Shift+Rec - metronome on/off (as metronome has much to do with recording)
5) Shift + Loop switch session/arrangement (as loop is the button that also changes in this case)
6) Shift + play Undo (as play is like backspace but turned opposite)

another parallel feature - Shift + drum pad in clip mode - stop the selected clip. 

7) display messages, when
   metronome on/off
   undo
   switch session/arrangement
   overdub
   automation arm
